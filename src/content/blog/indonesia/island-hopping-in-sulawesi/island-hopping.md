Our 60 day visa *entry* expiry date was 23.59 on the 21 May, so we entered Indonesia in good time 1h and half before at 22.30. We left Myanmar on a marathon journey involving three days of flights, buses and bemos including one day sightseeing in Singapore and sleeping in the airport, we felt like we needed island life urgently.

After a short stop in Jakarta we flew to Manado a city in the northern tip of Sulawesi, an Indonesian island where tourism hasn't yet diluted the local culture, where everyone stares at foreigners in a sincerely curious way.

We slept one night in Manado, which was long enough to notice the absence of dogs on the streets. The area is famous for eating dogs and from then on we carefully inspected our food for any canine traces. Manado is the gateway into a small island called Bunaken were serious divers head to for its abundant coral and lots of sea creatures. Due to its protected status as a National Marine Park it managed to escaped the last 20 years of dynamite and cyanid fishing which has devastated most of the corals of South East Asia.

After a 1h boat journey with friendly stary locals we found ourselves at the peaceful Bunaken Sea Garden Resort, a place which had been highly recommended where we ended up staying for a week. Our four star for the price of two bungalow faced a large garden which descended to the sea. So we could be floating over the aquarium right in front in no time.

Life in Bunaken is slow, as it is in the rest of Sulawesi. The days go by while alternating in between meals, naps and snorkelling sessions to a point that we lost track of what day of the week it was. Only in the sea every day was different.

The moon influenced the tides in such a way that at high tide there was no beach and low tide meant you could walk nearly all the way to the reef where there were a few resident turtles and the fish modelled on an underwater coral-walk, each exhibiting a palette of colourful designs permanently in fashion. The coral gardens were healthy and blooming, the best we saw in Sulawesi in fact, the visibility crystal clear and the steep drop off vertiginous. In three words: A ma zing.

On this high note we were blown towards the Togean Islands, equally known for having a slow pace and underwater beauty if a lot more remote and undeveloped. On the way there we quickly did a jungle trek at Tongkoko Nature Reserve, hung out with very sociable black macaques and managed to spot the cute nocturnal tarsiers returning to their sleeping tree in the morning.

Its not easy to get there. After a hellish 12h car journey to a city called Gorontalo and a much nicer one with an invitation to stay the night at our driver's home, who woke us up with a cup of the sweetest coffee in the world we were taken to the port in Bumbulan where we boarded the ferry to Dolong in the Togean Islands.

The journey was really comfy with lots of space and mats to lie on, and 7h later we arrived on the eastern tip of the archipelago. Over the next 10 days we slowly drifted west, from Waleakodi to Malenge and onto Bomba, one paradise island after the other.

Waleakodi has no roads so the only way to get there is by boat as with most of the Togeans. The only place to stay on the island, Sifa cottages is a sweet bunch of bungalows facing the picture perfect white sand beach complete with overhanging palm trees. So perfect it looks fake. We stayed here a couple of days snorkelling off the beach, but this was no Bunaken. The coral is mostly dead and even though there were fish, nowhere near as many. A sad result of the devastating fishing methods practiced until recently. However at night the water's edge turned into a stunning twinkle spectacle like I've never seen before: clear starry skies, trees covered with glowing fireflies and fluorescent plankton blinking in the seaweeds.

As paradisiac as Waleakodi was we felt like after 2 days it was time to move onto Malenge, another island we heard great things of, an hour away by boat. We arrived through the back door, a deep turquoise lagoon upon which Lestari guesthouse's restaurant was stilted. The front door on the other side was also faced by the ocean, where you could snorkel and where 100m away a rickety 1m wide wood bridge spanning **xxxx** connected fishing village and it's school.

Every evening party drums echoed from the village and every morning prayer calls woke us up for the sunrise spectacle. The rats joined in to the nocturnal soundtrack in our bungalow, attacking anything that smelled remotely eatable. Having heard Sulawesi rat tales before we tried to make sure we left everything out of our bags ready for them to take as they pleased luckily avoiding holes in our rucksacks and clothes.

Between a swim in the lagoon on one side and a snorkel on the other, we canoed to the village and took lots of photos of photogenic children who couldn't get enough of it. We managed to walk across the bridge trying not to look at the sea urchins underneath it, got lost trying to get back to the guesthouse via the overgrown jungle trail and stepped in an ants nest.

The snorkelling wasn't great in front of the guesthouse, but we got to watch one of the staff spear fishing every afternoon trying to catch fish for our dinner. We also joined a trip onto reef no5 (reefs in the area have numbers as names) this one being the best of them, and found the coral was really nice and healthy and got lucky to swim with black tip reef sharks.

At night the pier was an amphitheatre: there was always a lightning storm in the distance, falling stars till you had no more wishes to make and below the sea grass glittered away as if the plankton was getting electric shocks.

Lestari was also the best value for money we found in the Togeans, for 150.000IDR (just under Â£10 a night) we had a nice big wooden bungalow, pet rats and geckos, panoramic views of the wood bridge silhouetted by the sunrise every morning, and all meals included for 2. We could have stayed there forever.

But the public ferry picked us up in Malenge and after a 5h rough rainy journey dropped us in Wakai with 10 other tourists. The most foreigners we had seen in Indonesia so far. Everyone was headed to Kadidiri, and we were the only ones going to Bomba, on the southernmost tip of the islands. No public boats stopped there so we had to charter one which was expensive but worth it, as in Bomba we had the place practically to ourselves. The only guesthouse was Poya Lisa, on a beautiful private island, with a V shaped white sand beach. We got taken on free snorkelling trips to the nearby reefs where we saw schools of huge 2m bump-head fish and the visibility was so good it felt like a zoomed in lens.

At night we found out that the shimmering plankton also lived in the sand and experimented with that some more. We also befriended some more rats, but these guys had a taste for cocoa butter and soap and munched through ours all night.

Bomba was the sort of place I always imagined when I thought of hiding from the world and the kind of place that would make a perfect retreat for a writer. No distractions. No people. Nada but time to do nada. The only routine consisting of sunrise, breakfast, lunch, dinner and magical sunsets.

After 10 days in the Togean Islands we started dreaming of not having another meal of rice, fish (or egg for Kelvin) and sambal. And that was the only thing that made us want to move on. Even paradise isn't perfect after all.
