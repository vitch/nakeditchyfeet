We recently found out that Lonely Planet runs a weekly photo challenge on Flickr and we're proud to say that our first entry - into the "Sun Worship" challenge - was awarded joint third place.

The way the competition works is pretty simple. Each week a theme is set (the week we entered the theme was "Sun Worship"). You submit an image to the [Lonely Planet Flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/lonelyplanetpublications/) and tag it appropriately. Then you vote on five of the images submitted for the previous week's challenge. The winner each week is the photo that receives the most votes.

Luckily we were on Gili Meno when we saw the theme of "Sun Worship" and we had an amazing sunset to photograph. We went for a cheesy silhouette with Gili Trawangan and Bali's Gunung Agung in the background.

You can view the top five entries in the sun worship challenge [on Flickr](http://flickr.com/groups/lonelyplanetpublications/discuss/72157634750630289/) and keep an eye on the upcoming themes - maybe there is one you can enter yourself :)
