In three and a bit months in Indonesia we stayed in a whole variety of places. Most of them were nice but some were amazing - below is info on some of our favourites...

## Ocean Sun
Tulamben, Bali
350,000 (£22) / night (after a little bargaining)

Our most luxurious room in Indonesia! Set around a quiet landscaped garden with a small but very deep infinity pool (used to teach diving courses). We stayed in a large newly built bungalow with full height sliding glass doors and an outside Balinese bathroom with hot water and a rain shower. There was even decent WiFi which worked properly from the room.

There isn't much to do in Tulambem except diving (we stayed there while volunteering at Yayasin) but if you are in the area then we would definitely recommend staying here!

## Bagus bagus
Labon Banjo, Flores
250,000 (£16) / night

This "eco hotel" has a great location on the hill above Labon Bajo. The views of the bay from the terrace in front of our room were stunning. The room was clean and light with floor to ceiling windows and the staff we're really friendly. The guy who runs the hotel also runs a charity which is trying to clean up the plastic thrown into the sea and top educate the locals about the importance of looking after their environment.

It's a 5-10 minute walk down the hill to town and the paradise bar right next door is a great place for a sunset drink or to listen to the house bands reggae renditions.

##Lestari Malenge
Togian Islands, Sulawesi
100,000-150,000 (£6.50 - £9.50) per person per night including all meals

Location location location! That's what it's all about at Lestari Malenge. On one side you have the "blue lagoon" - a deep bay perfect for diving and swimming. On the other there is a lovely beach with views across to the Bugis (sea gypsy) village and the kilometre long rickety wooden bridge that connects it to the mainland.

The bungalows all have big porches with two hammocks to chill out on and the more expensive ones have en suite bathrooms.

The only downside is the rats! We found these everywhere we stayed on the Togians and they aren't a problem as long as you remember to hide any food (or food-like things - they also ate their way through a container of coco butter) in the wooden boxes provided.

Like all of the places on the Togian islands the prices are per person and all meals are included. The food was pretty good at Lestari although after a week or so the lack of variety starts to get a bit boring.

##Seger Reef
Kuta, Lombok
150,000 (£9.50) / night

Our large bungalow in Seger Reef was outstanding value for money. It had lots of space, hot water in the en-suite bathroom and a nice little balcony in front.

The location was also pretty good, just across the road from the beach. We had a motorbike the whole time in Kuta (essential so you can visit the beautiful surrounding coastline) and it was only a couple of minutes into our favourite warung in the middle of "town".

##Bunaken Sea Garden
Bunaken, Sulawesi
200,000 (£13) per person including all meals (in a superior room after a little bargaining)

Located right in front of some of the best snorkeling we had in Indonesia the new, clean bungalows are arranged around a nice garden. The four poster bed had a good mosquito net around it and there were two comfortable silk hammocks on the deck.

While there is no beach to speak of you are here for the snorkeling and it is amazing. There is a vertical dropoff about 50 metres from the shore with stunning coral and lots of fish and even a few turtles. At low tide you can walk most of the way there past the mangroves, swimming the last 10 metres in a channel through the reef. At high tide you can swim straight over the reef. The hotel also runs a dive centre with reasonably priced dives (€25) at dive sites around the island.

If you stay long enough you are sure to catch a "kolongkong" night when the staff pull out various musical instruments (including a drum kit fashioned from old tins) and the arak flows freely. A great night but the payback comes the day after in the form of a massive headache!
