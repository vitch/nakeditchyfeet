On the 16th April 2013 we set off from Heathrow with a [vague plan](/blog/planning/whats-the-plan/) and
some date-changeable intercontinental flights. Today it is exactly one year later and we are in the
Galapagos Islands looking back over an incredible year. In some ways it feels like we just left London
yesterday and in other ways it feels like a lifetime ago.

In the last year we have visited ten different countries: Thailand (three weeks), Myanmar (two weeks), 
Singapore (one day), Indonesia (three months), Australia (three and a half months), Fiji (one week), 
New Zealand (three months), the United States of America (two weeks in Hawaii and Los Angeles), Colombia
(nearly three weeks) and Ecuador (nearly two weeks so far). 

We changed the dates of every one of our flights at least once. And we gave up on the original plan of being
in Brazil in time for Carnival (at the end of February) because we kept getting caught up where ever we were. 
We decided instead that the start of the World Cup (in June) would be just as good a target.

We've been on twenty one flights, uncountable long distance buses, three overnight boat adventures and 
have driven more than 25,000km in the two vehicles we bought (and then managed to sell again!). 
We've also been to three weddings (of good friends from the UK who have moved to the southern hemisphere) 
and [one funeral](blog/indonesia/tana-toraja/) (of a man we had never met who had died more than a year 
earlier).

It's been amazing!

It's also been pretty busy - we have barely had time to figure out what we are doing tomorrow or next week,
let alone to sit back and reflect on all of the amazing experiences we have had or keep this site up 
to date. That is something that we're hoping to rectify over the next month or so - we're going to slow down
a bit and should have more time for reflection and to make our way through the massive backlog of photos 
waiting to be uploaded (we got really far behind while driving across Australia and
New Zealand and camping without power or internet). When we do upload photos they automatically slip in
to the blog on the date they were taken - if you want to keep track of this then [follow us](/follow-us/) 
and get email updates when there is new content.

In the meantime, here is a quick time line with some of the highlights from the trip so far:

 * **Month 1** - Thailand and ~~Myanmar~~Burma
   * Arriving on [Koh Mak](/photos/72157633406184851/) - a beautiful tropical island where the boat is met by 
     mashed up VW camper vans which take you down the single lane road to the beach with the accomodation on.
   * Visiting [a golden rock](/photos/72157633847610282/) in Myanmar where we met a pilgrim and a monk who
     shared fruit and juice with us and explained about life in Burma.
   * Watching the sun set over the thousands of temples on the plain in [Bagan](/photos/72157634276252386/).
 * **Month 2** - ~~Myanmar~~Burma, Singapore and Sulawesi
   * Snorkelling and diving in [Bunaken](/photos/72157634289527793/) - the most amazing coral and tropical fish
     that we've seen anywhere on this trip.
   * Relaxing on [the Togean Islands](/blog/indonesia/island-hopping-in-sulawesi/) - especially at 
     [Lestari Malenge](/photos/72157634713459842/) where there was a great beach, a lagoon to swim in and a 
     really long ramshackle wooden bridge to the fishing village on the other side.
 * ** Month 3** - Sulawesi, Flores and Lombok
   * Being guests at a [traditional funeral](/blog/indonesia/tana-toraja/) in Tana Toraja, complete with a
     mummified corpse and buffalo sacrifices.

   * Climbing [Gunung Rinjani](/photos/72157638024700505/) in Lombok. The three day, 3,726 meter climb was really

It's also been pretty busy - a far cry from the "long holiday" vibe I was expecting when we left the UK.

It turns out that travelling to so many places and seeing so much is actually pretty time consuming and we
haven't had much time to reflect on everything we have seen and experienced

When we set of from Heathrow nine months ago we had a [vague plan](/blog/planning/whats-the-plan/) and
some international date-changeable flights. In some ways that feels like a lifetime ago and in other ways
it feels like it was only yesterday.

In the nine months so far we've visited seven countries - Thailand (two weeks), Myanmar (two weeks), 
Singapore (one day), Indonesia (nearly four months), Australia (three months), Fiji (one week) and New Zealand
(just over a month so far). We've taken eleven flights, uncountable of long distance buses, two overnight boats
and driven over 25,000km. And we have had some amazing experiences.

It turns out that full time travel is actually quite time consuming and we've felt that we've needed a holiday
from the travelling more than once. It might sound like a terribly first world problem but constantly planning
your next step and trying to make the most of the
