Australia can be a very expensive country to travel in and we found that a
great way to keep costs down was by "free camping".	The quality of free camping 
areas varies wildly - you will find everything from beautiful spots right on 
the beach with flush toilets to carparks with no facilities and a "no camping" 
sign. After driving nearly 12,000km and camping for the best part of three and 
a half months here are some of our favourites.

##1. East Bay Campground

Located **x**km down a side street from the highway between Albany and Esperance in
Western Australia this was our undisputed favourite free camp - it was much 
better than most paid camps. Right on the edge of a beautiful beach there was
about five nicely separated camping spots. The flush toilet was wonderfully clean
and fully stocked with toilet paper and there were plenty of freshly emptied bins.

While the road down to the site was unsealed it was in great condition and no
problem in our old 2WD van. Completely worth it for the experience of watching
the sun set over the white sand of the beautiful east bay from our little table
next to our van.

##2. Frank Potts Reserve

While the camp area here is nice enough - a well shaded grass area with picnic 
tables and long drop toilets - the main attraction of this site was the location.

Situated in the Langhorne Creek wine making region it is nestled inbetween 
several wineries. You can walk to the cellar doors for tastings without having
to worry about who is doing the driving afterwards. And you can also walk to the
local pub for an authentic Australian country pub experience and some delicious
grub.

##3. Albert Tognolini Rest Area

Albert Tognolini was a surveyor who planned the route of the XXX highway between
X and Y. His namesake rest area is a beautiful spot a stones throw from the 
equally beautiful Karijini National Park. Stunning views over the highway snaking 
its way up through a gorge and the rest of the surrounding area and lots of shady
spots to park up. The only problem with it was the lack of any facilities - not
a place you'd want to get caught short!


##4. Johanna Beach

##Free camping tips

###How to find free campsites

There are a number of ways of finding where it's possible to camp for free and
our undisputed favourite was with the [WikiCamps](http://wikicamps.com) app on
our smartphones. This app gives you access to a user generated database of 
thousands of places in Australia including caravan parks, places of interest and
free camps. Each place can be seen on a map and tapped to bring up a description. 
Users can add ratings, comments, prices and photos to a place so that you get a 
good idea of what it is like before you arrive. And as long as you download the
information in advance it all works offline which is a necessity if you are 
travelling through outback areas.

Using the app was pretty simple. We'd look at the map and decide how far we 
thought we'd make it that day and look for suitable sites around the right place.
The ratings and comments made it easy to choose good spots and we could revise 
our plans throughout the day if we were going faster or slower than expected.

There is a filter facility in the app so that you can just look at free sites but
we often found it best to click through everything in about the right place - if
a caravan park was reasonably priced and highly rated then sometimes it was worth 
it to have a shower (see below).

An less high tech version of WikiCamps are the "Camps" books ("Camps 7" is the 
current edition - a new one is released annually). Often sold along with second 
hand backpacker vans many people told us this was "the bible" of free camping in
Australia. We had Camps 7 and found it vastly inferior to WikiCamps since the 
descriptions are shorter and there is no chance for "punters" to add up to
date information. I think that they also have a smartphone app but we had 
already discovered WikiCamps by the time we heard of it so we never tried it.

###Staying clean

Since the majority of free camp areas have limited facilities (often long drop
toilets and no showers) we would always be on the lookout for showers. 

In some places (like the drive accross the Nullabour) there were service stations 
that would let you use their showers for a few dollars. These were mentioned in
comments in Wikicamps. In other places there were facilities provided by the
local council near a beach or town center.

We also kept an eye out for swimming pools - in inland New South Wales there
was a few towns with outdoor Olympic sizes pools with free entry! 

Then there is always the option of paying to stay in a caravan park for a night 
- something we ended up doing about once or twice a week.
