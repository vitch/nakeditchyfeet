Going to the Galapagos islands was never part of our original plan, but we were invited to celebrate Kelvin's mum's 60th birthday on a cruise through the islands and as we were only up the road in Colombia it was an absolute no-brainer!

Carol (Kelvin's mum) organised the whole trip, a very stressful thing to do as the options are so many and it was risky deciding on what boat to choose in advance. For us however it was the first bit of our trip when we were relaxed and had to make no choices - that was fab! After much deliberating and worrying she chose [the Beagle](http://www.thebeagle.com.ec/Beagle.htm), which turned out to be an awesome boat and definitely the best choice.

We flew from Quito in Ecuador via Guayaquil to the island of Santa Cruz in the archipelago of the Galapagos Islands. A short while after landing a bus took a load of us to the harbour where we first saw The Beagle. Only a couple of other boats shared the harbour with the much larger sail boat and it looked sweet. We were all eager to get on board to check out where we would be spending the next eight days and unpack.

We boarded the Panga (an inflatable speed boat) for the first time with our naturalist guide for the week - Daniel - and got driven to the Beagle, where we were received by the crew with a welcome cocktail. After being introduced to everyone we were shown our cabins and given some minutes to settle in. We then had our first three course meal of the week while sailing towards Bachas Beach where we got to see our very first pelicans, flamingos, iguanas and Sally Lightfoot crabs. They all looked special, exotic and we felt so lucky to see them (little we knew they would be everywhere in the next few days).

After a nice swim and snorkelling in murky waters we got back on board of the Beagle for afternoon cocktail, snack, shower and briefing before the three course dinner was served. The briefing consisted mainly of our guide explaining what we were due to be doing the following day which invariably combined snorkeling and hiking, three course meals, cocktails and naps. What an awesome week that was!

We did the northern circuit of the Galapagos which included Genovesa, Santiago and Isabella Islands. The northern circuit is a bit less busy than the southern one so for the whole week we saw only a couple of other groups and boats, and most of the time the islands and their waters were ours to explore alone.

In Genovesa we visited the site where a huge bird colony lives. There were stupid amounts of red footed boobies, NASCAR boobies and frigate birds all minding their business while we took as many photos as we liked from as close as a meter from them. The snorkelling adventures were replete with fur seals and stingrays. Not a bad birthday for Carol, which ended in more cocktails and a cake especially baked by our talented chef....

On day three of the journey we left Genovesa and sailed to Santiago. In the morning we took the panga to shore and went for a walk along the lava flats and met up with hundreds of marine iguanas. These guys posed forever, and disguised so well against the black rock that we really had to watch our step not to walk on one. They piled on top of each other soaking the sun rays and projected snot a log way away in loud sneezes. It was quite disgusting but nonetheless fascinating stuff.

Further ahead we reached a playing ground for fur seals. Some used tunnelled sea caves as reverse slides and showed up at the surface of the water inside a hole in the rock before being taken away again by the ocean. Others simply twirled and played with each other in the rise and fall of the waves inside cave pools while we watched from above as if looking into a well. The best though, was to watch them surf. It looked like so much fun, you could see their bodies riding inside the glassy wave and it looked perfect, again and again.

And then day four topped it all. Not only we had some very special encounters with fur seals, who were so close we could have touched the beauties (we didn't!) and stare into their big round eyes, but we saw Galapagos Penguins, the northernmost penguins in the world.

Could it get any better? Only if we had seen Giant tortoises on our afternoon walk in Tagus Cove, but these huge Galapagos (means giant tortoise) are not only shy but low in numbers and live far deep inland these days. Still we had a stunning walk and got great moonscape views of the interior of the island before jumping back on board of the Beagle for some more... delicious sunset cocktails!

The rest of the week brought more beautiful barren lava fields, ladies finger banana cactus, snotty iguanas, blue and red footed boobies, inflated frigates lots of hungry turtles and finally we got to swim with the penguins. They are incredible to watch and such fast swimmers chasing their lunch and changing direction so suddenly that it must have been hilarious to watch us snorkellers attempting to keep up with them and failing.

The snorkelling in the Galapagos is in a league of its own. It can't be compared to anything else I have ever seen, not in terms of coral which is pretty much non-existent, nor visibility which is mostly crap. But when it comes to getting up close and being able to interact with fur seals, observe marine iguanas, penguins and of course sea turtles for as long as you like as much as you like, it is unrivalled.

The Beagle ran on motor for most of the week but the wind picked up a couple of times and the sails went up, it was a beautiful sight. We sailed across the equator line twice, once with huge shy Giant Mola Molas swimming all around us and the second time the engines stopped and we had a swim at zero degrees latitude.

At the end of the cruise we all had had such a good time, no one wanted to leave the Beagle. The food, the company, the crew, Daniel, the cocktails and the wildlife were all outstanding, and considering that there are 250 boats licensed to do these trips around the Galapagos we felt like we were special, and that nature had really put on a show for our eyes only. It took a couple of days after leaving for reality to hit and us to stop daydreaming of life on The Beagle.

We managed to still explore the islands a little longer, using San Cristobal as our base for a few more days. In that time we were chased in more than one occasion by the towns playful/territorial sea lions along the pier, surfed on the wild side of Tortuga Bay, while the sheltered mangrove side of the beach teemed with baby reef sharks who slowly swam around our ankles in the shallow waters.

We did manage to see giant tortoises in San Cristobal, some of them were over 100 years old and counting. It was interesting to contemplate that all those baby turtles, so tiny the size of my hand, will long outlive all of us. I guess there aren't that many animals in the world that can say that.

We are very lucky to have been able to experience this thanks to Carol who planned, organised and paid for our Beagle adventure, thank you Carol, it was certainly the journey of a lifetime!
