Going to the Galapagos Islands was never featured on our travel plans, until Carol (Kelvin's mum) decided to celebrate her 60th birthday on a cruise through the islands. An invitation and a privilege we couldn't refuse.

Carol planned the whole thing, which meant that we were also spared all the stress of choosing one from the many boats on offer, whether to book in advance or last minute, which itinerary to choose. So this was gladly the first time in nearly a year that we had to make no choices. 

After much deliberating and worrying [the Beagle](http://www.thebeagle.com.ec/Beagle.htm) was chosen, a dreamy looking boat with sails, which would be spending a week sailing us from island to island in search of evolutionary wonders.

Full of expectations, we flew from Quito in Ecuador via Guayaquil and onto the island of Santa Cruz in the archipelago of the Galapagos Islands. A short while after landing a bus took us and a load of freshly landed tourists to the harbour where we saw The Beagle for the first time. Sharing the bay with couple of other smaller boats it's double masts stood out and we couldn't wait to get on board and check out where we would be spending the next eight days, unpack our bags and go for a swim.

The Panga (an inflatable speed boat) awaited us and our naturalist guide for the week - Daniel - led us towards the boat, where we were received by the crew with an amazing welcome pinacolada. After the introductions we were shown our cabins and given some time to settle in. We then had our first three course meal of the week while sailing towards Bachas Beach where we got to see pelicans take flight, sat on the sand watching as two bright pink flamingos tip toed around a lake getting all territorial with each other, and iguanas and Sally Lightfoot crabs populated the surrounding lava rocks. 


Finnaly we had that longed for swim while some of us tried snorkelling in murky waters, followed by another cocktail back on board, a snack, shower and a briefing before the three course dinner was served. The briefing was a daily ocurrence and consisted mainly of Daniel explaining what we were due to be doing the following day, which invariably combined snorkeling and hiking around the islands, several three course meals, cocktails and afternoon naps. We just couldn't argue with that.

We had chosen to do the northern circuit of the Galapagos Islands which included visiting Genovesa, Santiago and Isabella Islands. The northern circuit is less busy than the southern one so for the whole week we saw only a couple of boats, and most of the time the islands and their waters were ours to explore alone.

On day two it was Carol's birthday so she got to get up very early to eat a delicious breakfast. Afterwards we visited Genovesa Island where a huge bird colony nests along the cliffs and where there were hundreds of strange birds - red footed boobies, NASCAR boobies and frigate birds - all minding their mating business while we pointed and photgraphed them from so close we could almost touch them. The snorkelling sessions of the day were replete with fur seals and stingrays who similarly to the birds didn't mind our presence or persistence. Not a bad birthday for Carol, after returning to the boat there were more cocktails and even a birthday cake especially baked on board by the talented chef.

On day three of the journey we left Genovesa and sailed to Santiago. In the morning we took the panga to shore and went for a walk along the lava flats and met up with hundreds of marine iguanas. These guys posed forever, and disguised so well against the black rock that we really had to watch our step not to walk on one. They piled on top of each other soaking the sun rays and projected snot a log way away in loud sneezes. It was quite disgusting but nonetheless fascinating stuff.

Further along we reached a playing ground for fur seals who used tunnelled sea caves as reverse slides showing up at the surface of the water inside holes in the rock, before being taken away again by the ocean. Others simply twirled and played with each other in the rise and fall of the waves inside cave pools while we watched from above as if looking into a well. But the best, was to watch them surf. You could see their bodies riding inside the glassy wave and it looked perfect, again and again. They must have been having so much fun.


Day four topped it all. Not only we had some very special encounters with fur seals swimming so close up by us and being able to look into their big round eyes, but we also saw Galapagos Penguins as they soaked the sun, as would the northernmost penguins in the world. 

We didn't think it could get any better. Maybe if we had seen Giant tortoises on our afternoon hike in Tagus Cove, but the huge Galapagos (after who the islands were named after) are not only shy but very endangered and hide deep inland these days. Still, we had a stunning walk with moonscape panorama views of the interior of the island and the cove where the Beagle anchored waiting for us with some mojitos.

The rest of the week brought more barren lava fields, ladie's-finger-banana cactus, snotty iguanas, colouful footed boobies, inflated frigates, lots of hungry sea turtles and we got in a swim with the penguins. These fast swimmers were incredible to watch as they chased their lunch and changed course so suddenly that it would have been hilarious to watch this bunch of snorkellers attempting to keep up with them.

The snorkelling in the Galapagos is in a league of its own. It can't be compared to anywhere on earth because nowhere else can be found these unique creatures. The coral is pretty much non-existent, the visibility is poor most of the time, but when it comes to getting up close and being able to interact with these animals, observing them for as long as you like, it is unrivalled.

The Beagle ran on motor for most of the week but the wind picked up a couple of times and the sails went up, it was a beautiful very slow sight. We sailed across the equator line twice, first time chasing huge Giant Mola Molas and the second time we were treated to a swim at zero degrees latitude.


At the end of the cruise we all had had such a good time, no one wanted to pack up and leave the Beagle. The food, the company, the crew, Daniel, the cocktails and the wildlife were all outstanding. There are 250 boats licensed to do these trips around the Galapagos but we felt like we had chosen the most special of all, and nature really put on a show for our eyes only. It took a couple of days after leaving to stop daydreaming of life on The Beagle.



There was more exploring to do. Using the town of San Cristobal as our base for a few more days we were chased in more than one occasion by the territorial sea lions along the pier, surfed on the wilder side of Tortuga Bay, while the sheltered mangrove side of the same teemed with baby reef sharks who slowly swam around our ankles in the shallow waters.

We did finally manage to see giant tortoises in San Cristobal, some of them were over 100 years old and counting. There aren't many animals in the world capable to outlive most humans, definitely something to contemplate in wonder.

We left the islands feeling lucky to have been able to experience this and thankful to Carol for making it happen, it was the stuff that dreams are made of.
