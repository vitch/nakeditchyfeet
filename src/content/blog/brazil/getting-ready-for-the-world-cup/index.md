In just a few months, Brazil will be the host of the next World Cup.
While this is exciting for football fans around the world, and for Brazil's tourism industry, the costs of hosting the games are leaving Brazilian tax payers with a high bill to pay for in the future, as the government has already blown the budget, and hasn't even built the infrastructure promised to outlive the games as legacy.

In a country where much of the population still live in poverty, it is extravagant to be spending billions of reals on entertainment. Still, preparation for the event has created jobs, but the reality is that the money coming in from ticket sales is going straight to FIFA's pockets and not to the average Brazilian.

As a reaction to the grandiose spending, many people have suggested a boycott of the World Cup, but is this really the best way to help the country? Going down this road may actually have a negative impact on the already bad situation Brazilian tax payers are finding themselves in.

Whether it may be a good idea or not, the games are happening. And if their worth isn't being invested in education, healthcare and public infrastructure, World Cup fans and Brazilian tourists alike, can and should attempt to counteract the negative effects and use their visit to have a positive impact on people's lives, both before arriving in Brazil and once there are there.

Here are a few ideas of small things that you can do to make your World Cup more Brazilian:

##Before arriving in Brazil:

###Book locally owned accommodation

 * Book your accommodation with a small Guesthouse (a Pousada in Portuguese) instead of a hotel. Not only will doing this ensure that the money you're spending in the country is going into small businesses but your experience will be much more authentic.
 *If you spent all your money on air fares and event tickets you could consider Couchsurfing. Both you and your hosts will be winning, and you will be learning about Brazil from the locals.
 * Airbnb is also a good alternative to Pousadas, where people rent their spare rooms. Your experience will liken that of Couchsurfing, except that it wont be free, but it will be worth it.

###Learn Portuguese

More and more Brazilians are learning English, but most people still dont really speak it, especially if you are visiting smaller cities. So it will come in handy if you know some basic Portuguese, and yes, there is an app for that. Duolingo is a really handy free website and mobile app which even lets you learn Portuguese offline.

###Learn about the history of the country 

The World Cup celebrates different cultures coming together in their love of footbal, and this year they do so in a place which performs that celebration everyday. Brazil is a melting pot of cultures which resulted from various waves of forced and voluntary immigration through the last 500 years, so not only it is important to know about all this history but it is also interesting stuff. Having an idea of the bakground of this vibrant country will help you get closer to Brazilians and less caught up in the tourist trail.

##While you are in Brazil:

###Eat with the locals

  * The World Cup is sponsored by big names such as McDonalds and Coca Cola. This means that in many host cities across Brazil, FIFA has banned street vendors from setting up their stalls within a two mile radius of the stadiums, some have even been evicted from their usual places, and aren't allowed to earn a living as they always have just so more burgers can be sold.

  With this in mind, do your best to avoid the fast food giants in or around the game venues, and seek to get away after the games and find some local food to tuck into.
  * Choose small, family owned restaurants and spend you money at local businesses instead of chains, this way your money will be fed into the businesses that need it most.

###Volunteer
Chances are that you will try to make a holiday of your time in Brazil, so why not donate your time and volunteer as well. There are many organisations who welcome helping hands all over the country, from orphanages to women's refuges, to teaching English and building houses in favelas. Here are just a few ideas to get you started:

 * **Education**

###Party with the locals:

With poverty and wealth rubbing shoulders, the organisers of the cup are trying to do their best to hide poor neighbourhoods from the eyes of tourists. An example of this sweeping under the carpet is Salvador da Bahia where a bridge linking the stadium with the tourist area of town has been built to bypass a poor area, But it is that which embarrasses the organisers that should make them proud. After all it is the richly multicultural people that make Brazil the vibrant country it is, and you wouldn't want to miss that.

##Tourism as usual
For many people the World Cup will be a time to avoid as accommodation prices rise and it is in general busier. But you shouldn't let the big event put you off visiting Brazil. According to past World Cup surveys, tourism in hosting countries is the same as previous years, so while there may be more tourists coming for the World Cup, many will decide not to.
If the numbers of tourists are a minus, the atmosphere will hopefully make up for it by hundreds. And if you are concerned about accommodation prices, remember couchsurfing?

If you aren't going to the World Cup but still want to help reduce the impact it will have on the issues Brazil already has in hands, you can donate the value of a ticket bid to a Brazilian charity or NGO. They will give meaning to your World Cup.

These are only some ideas of what we can do. But if you would like to suggest others ways of making the World Cup an event to which the Brazilian people are also invited to, please leave a comment.
