##Flights

We researched for months trying to find a winner in the rtw vs individual flights. As our route involves South America we found that a rtw would be around £2300. However if we found out that flying into North America would bring the cost down to £1300, and a flight from LA to Bogota in Colombia is around £100.

We then considered all sorts of RTW flight options, there are many travel agencies offering them, and there are also airline programmes which offer rtw tickets based in mileage and stops but they all have a drawback which for us was decisive – they are limited to a year from departure. But the issue with booking a flight at a time as you go along would be visa entry requirements as many countries require a flight out of the country in order to let you in, plus these are normally not changeable.

We then found out that STA Travel offer another option. It is like an RTW ticket because you book all flights as part of the same agreement which they have with SATA, but this means that all dates are changeable if you pay £100(for the whole trip) and you have as long as you like to use your flights so if you decide to stay longer somewhere you wont risk voiding your future flights.

##Guide Books
The problem with guide books is having to carry them around. We wanted to have the information with us so we could read about the upcoming destinations and plan ahead while in other countries. We decided that Kindle/PDF books was the way to go. The great thing about having these on your kindle or tablet is that you can have as many as you like, they don’t become annoying and heavy, plus yiu can download samples of both rough guide and Lonely planet for the country you are going to and compare them so you choose which is the best before you buy. The only downside is that it is not as easy to pick up like a book and flick through the page you want quickly, but it just takes getting used to that. Only a minor problem compared to having to carry all the books around with us!
