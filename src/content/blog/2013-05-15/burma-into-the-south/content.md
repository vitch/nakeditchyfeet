We made a last minute decision to visit this mysterious country as it won't be long until it changes. We wanted to see the genuine side of what they now call Myanmar.

Yangon is our gateway and straight away we felt like we had set foot in a world apart. Ten minutes after our flight landed the airport lights were switched off and the immigration officers left, presumably only to come back when the next flight landed.

Burma is starting to open its arms to independent travellers but there are still many parts of the country where foreigners aren’t allowed - either due to conflicts, lack of infrastructure, or just because the government doesn’t want the world to see what's happening in those areas.

Yangon is a friendly city, full of street food and bustling streets with goats and chicken mixing up with cars and bikes and where the pavements are people’s workshops and kitchens. Everyone is still curious about foreigners and you are watched with childish whispering and dropped jaws until you break the ice with a "Mingalabar" – Burmese for Hello – and get gentle smiles all round.

In Yangon we enquired about heading south and got confirmation that south of Mawlamyine was still out of bounds, but we thought we would head there and see some local caves and head on a boat trip. After an 8h bumpy bus ride we arrived in Mawlamyine, checked into the Breeze Guesthouse and by the evening a rumour that you were allowed further south was spreading. This was confirmed in the morning and we left that evening towards Dawei.

The bus journey was an agony, the road was in very poor condition and the bus too uncomfortable to sleep, and it played the burmese hits on max. It was pitch dark outside, so we had no idea what the landscapes we were passing were like. We did notice a few military check points, no hassle on them however we did get lights shined on our faces.

We had no idea where we would be staying, or even if there was anywhere to stay. We were told the area had just been opened to foreigners, maybe 10 people had been down there but there were no reports of what happened, if they liked it, where they stayed, what they saw.

We arrived in Dawei at sunrise, someone in our party of excited foreigners heading towards the unknown south spoke Thai and luckily so did one of the tuk tuk drivers. No one spoke even basic English. After a few minutes we were heading to a guesthouse in Maungmakan beach.

We were taken to Coconut guesthouse, who are apparently the only guesthouse licensed to take foreigners. The manager Sandar and the staff were absolute gems and looked after us really well. Sandar speaks amazing English and took us around on bikes one day to see the area.

The beach is gorgeous, not the turquoise sea and white sand gorgeous, but the big wide black sand expanse, with playful warm waves and no one in sight except for a few locals gorgeous. It is apparently a popular place for Burmese holidaying in high season, and it looked so from the amount of (now closed) restaurants along the beach.

We enjoyed a couple of days staying at Coconut and playing in the waves and watching the stunning sunsets with a cold beer. Not much to do in low season, but otherwise there are fishing trips organised by Coconut and a beach pagoda which takes about 30 minutes to walk to along the beach or 2.30 by road.

One day while at the beach we were surrounded by 200 children who wanted to take our photo, we had seen them rehearsing some sort of choreography in one of the restaurants and didn’t really expect them to come running straight to us when they were finished, they were on a day out with a charity and very excited to see white people dressed funny.

We did some more asking and found out that it was possible to go even further south to Myeik, which is located right next to an archipelago of 800 phuket-like (but virgin) islands. We had to go and have a look so we hopped on another 10h bus ride. This time in daylight and even though the road was still mostly inexistent and no one could sleep, the views were amazing. Green, rural, hilly, a million times more beautiful than the landscapes between Yangon and Dawei. Villages of wood huts with palm tree leaves as roofs, rice paddies and bamboo plantations abound. As well as military compounds which are normally followed by an NLD office a few hundred metres ahead.

After crossing a river as if the bus was some sort of all terrain vehicle and a short ferry across a large river we got to Myeik. We quickly found out that all accommodation was very expensive, and we weren’t allowed on any boats, so we had a look around, visited the pagoda on the hill for great views over the city and booked a flight back to Yangon for the following day. Myeik failed to impress, for its walking-dead dogs and its stinky river front. Maybe this will change when the government allows foreigners to explore the islands, but for the time being venturing south of Dawei is only really worth for the lovely scenery on the way, if you can spare $140 for the flight back to Yangon.
