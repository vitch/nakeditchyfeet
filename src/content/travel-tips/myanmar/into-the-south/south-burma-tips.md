On our [trip to the south of Myanmar](/blog/myanmar/into-the-south/) we had to do quite a bit of investigation into the available options for accommodation and travel. This is the difficulty of travelling in an area before it's covered in the guidebook! The below is what we found out - hopefully it is useful to others.

##Dawei

###Accommodation:

**Coconut Bungalows and Restaurant**  
Phaw Taw Oo Street, after the ice factory  
Maungmakan Village, Launglon Township  
Tel 09 8752293, 09 7370052  
Manager: Sandar Aye

$35 all rooms with ensuite and brand new, the restaurant is a little expensive but in high season you should find food on the beach

Maungmakan Village is a 20min motorbike ride from Dawei.

###Eat:

**Daw San, Family rice and curry shop**  
No 506 Hospital Road, Myautyuar quarter, Dawei  
This restaurant is in Dawei but worth it if you are in town, the food was tasty and the restaurant clean.

##Myeik

###Accommodation:

 * **Dolphin guesthouse**  
   Not in the centre but nice big rooms with air con and very clean – $40.
 * **Sun Guesthouse**  
   Closer to the centre but expensive – $35 single/$50 double. Has Wifi. Reception staff really really didn't seem to want us to check in and changed the price repeatedly while we looked around.
 * **Kyai Pyan Hotel**  
   Dirty and overpriced with air con – $40. Good breakfast(included). Wifi opposite but too slow.

###Eat
A few places by the river: Thai Palace, there is a BBQ and a place that does Naan with chickpea dhal.

A few doors from Kyai Pyan Hotel, Ban Engi Burmese food very good variety of dishes.
